## 💡 Key Insights from Alex

### 1. Claude as Daily Coach
> "Every day I tell it what I'm working on and what my goals are. It gives me awesome feedback."

This is about using Claude for **strategic guidance**, not just task execution.

### 2. Overnight Agent Pattern (Claude Mobile)
> "Download the Claude mobile app. There is a new Code section. In this section you can literally spin up cloud AI agents that do work for you while you sleep."

**Implementation:**
1. Open Claude mobile app
2. Go to Code section
3. Kick off 3 small tasks before bed
4. Wake up to completed work

**Benefits:**
- Builds momentum
- Compounds over time
- Even tiny visual changes count

### 3. AI Agent for X Monitoring
Alex built an AI agent that:
- Monitors X all day
- Writes hours of content automatically
- Acts as an "AI employee"

*Video walkthrough available (no technical experience required)*

### 4. Claude Code Workflow
> "Claude Code is the best AI tool on the planet right now. There is no other tool that makes it easier for ANYONE to build apps."

Alex has a specific workflow for CC that he considers "the greatest workflow EVER."

### 5. Claude Skills
